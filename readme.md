`PhotoDrop`

<h1>Requirements for task:</h1>

So, we are looking for photoDrop app from you.

The main idea of this project is the interaction of photographers and clients who want to get their photos.

The application will consist of two applications. The first is part of the photographers. Photographers take pictures of people and then upload the photos to our service. AI matches photos of users by their faces will simulate this by assigning users to photos with their hands do (it yourself without AI just with the list of users). The second is the client side, where clients register and receive albums with their photos and can pay to get them without a watermark.

These will be two different applications.
